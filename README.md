exam :^)

pom.xml files are adapted from Andrea's github, specifically lesson 11 solution.
Classes such as Application, LocalApplicationRunner and RedirectForwardHandler are technically the same as in the repo, but since there's no real code in them I didn't specify a link to GitHub for them. 

Also they're just as much (if not more) from my own exercises.




TESTS

testGetSortedReviews() gave a warning due to comparing dates, but it never failed for me after I added thread.sleep. 
Not going to write tests for getters and setters in backend, as Anders (lecturer) said this is redundant.
