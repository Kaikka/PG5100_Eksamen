exam :^)


Classes such as Application, LocalApplicationRunner and RedirectForwardHandler are technically the same as in the repo, but since there's no real code in them I didn't specify a link to GitHub for them. Also they're just as much (if not more) from my own exercises.

Default info in DefaultDataInitializerService are not written by me, but taken from IMDB.

Not going to write tests for getters and setters in backend, as Anders (lecturer) said this is redundant.
